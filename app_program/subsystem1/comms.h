/*
 * comms.h  --  Buddy 1 (WiFi / MQTT communication and telemetry)
 *
 * The one interface the rest of the team uses.
 *
 *   comms_init(cfg)        set up (does not block, does not touch the radio)
 *   comms_send(sample)     put one telemetry sample in the send queue
 *   comms_get_command()    read START / STOP / RESET sent from the broker
 *   comms_led_task()       drive the status LED from the COM state
 *   comms_get_state()      COM_DISCONNECTED / COM_SYNC / COM_CONNECTED
 *   comms_get_stats()      counters (acked, discarded, queued, commands)
 *   comms_now_ms()         milliseconds since comms_init(), for ts
 *   comms_task()           the network work: reconnect, send, receive
 *
 * WHO CALLS WHAT
 *
 *   micro T-Kernel build (the team's base):
 *     - comms_task() is called by the WiFi task (cyw43_utk_task). That task is
 *       the only owner of lwIP, so all network work happens there. YOU DO NOT
 *       CALL comms_task().
 *     - comms_init() is called once from subsystem1_init().
 *     - comms_send(), comms_led_task() are called from Telemetry_Comms_Task
 *       (one task only).
 *     - comms_get_command() is called by the Nav task (one task only).
 *     - comms_get_state() and comms_get_stats() can be called from any task.
 *
 *   Plain Pico SDK bench build (testing/subsystem1/bench):
 *     - one loop calls comms_send(), comms_task(), comms_led_task() and
 *       comms_get_command() every ~10 ms.
 *
 * WHY THE SPLIT: comms_send() only puts the message in a small inbox (lock
 * free, never blocks). comms_task() moves it into the 100-message queue and
 * sends it. So the sending task and the WiFi task never share the queue and
 * need no mutex. Likewise the commands go from comms_task() to
 * comms_get_command() through a small ring.
 *
 * Rules:
 *  - comms_send(): ONE task only. comms_get_command(): ONE task only.
 *  - comms_task() never blocks. A WiFi or broker problem never stops the
 *    caller (FR-COM-02).
 *  - This component never touches the motors. A command is only reported
 *    through comms_get_command(). Nav decides what to do with it.
 *
 * The pure logic is in trans_queue, com_state, status_led and telemetry,
 * which are tested on a PC. comms.c (the engine) is tested on a PC with a
 * fake radio and a fake broker. The two small "ports" (comms_port_utk.c and
 * bench/comms_port_sdk.c) are the only parts that touch real hardware.
