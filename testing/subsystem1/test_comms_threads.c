/*
 * test_comms_threads.c -- two threads share the inbox and the command ring,
 * like a sending task and the task that runs comms_task() would on the car.
 *
 * Thread A (the "Telemetry task") calls comms_send() and comms_get_command().
 * Thread B (the "WiFi task") calls comms_task() and plays the broker.
 * Checks that nothing is lost, repeated, reordered or corrupted.
 *
 * LIMIT: a PC (x86) orders memory writes strongly, so this proves the index
 * logic under real interleaving but NOT the memory-barrier placement. The
 * barriers (PORT_MB) are checked by reading the code, and on the board.
 *
 * Each check prints an ID S1-Rnn. Add new checks at the END.
 * Build and run from the repo root (see run_pc_tests.sh for the flags):
 *   gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -pthread -DCOMMS_HOST_TEST -Itesting/subsystem1/stubs \
 *       -Iapp_program/subsystem1 testing/subsystem1/test_comms_threads.c \
 *       app_program/subsystem1/{trans_queue,com_state,status_led,telemetry}.c -o /tmp/t
